# Armoured Combat Framework 4.0

The Armoured Combat Framework is a [Garry's Mod][] addon which creates a balanced, realistic and fun to play combat damage system, simulating projectiles, armor and explosions, as well as engines and gearboxes.

ACF 4.0 is built from the greatly appreciated work of https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF in ACF 2.0, but will contain many improvements down the line.

The end goals of ACF 4.0 are full compatibility with
- ACF 1.0
- XCF
- ACF 2.0
- ACE

ACF 3.0 broke compatibility with most of the former mods mentioned above.


This project is being developed exclusively by Darkstorm Servers, if you would like more information on our community, or to help shape the development of ACF4, please visit https://darkstorm.cc
